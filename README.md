# Transferrable-Plant-Disease-Detection
Repo for a deep learning project to create a detector to tell if a leaf is healthy or not, transferrable to unseen species

## Dataset
The test and validation sets are from the [PlantVillage](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1) dataset, reclassified into just two categories: healthy vs diseased.

The training set is from a combination of the [PlantLeaves](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hb74ynkjcn/1) and the [PlantaeK](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/t6j2h22jpx/1) datasets.
